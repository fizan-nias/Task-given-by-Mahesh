What is a startup script?? A startup script is a file that performs tasks during the startup process of a virtual machine (VM) instance. Startup scripts can apply to all VMs in a project or to a single VM. Startup scripts specified by VM-level metadata override startup scripts specified by project-level metadata, and startup scripts only run when a network is available. This document describes how to use startup scripts on Linux VM instances. For information about how to add a project-level startup script, see gcloud compute project-info add-metadata.
